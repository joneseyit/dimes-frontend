    - How to 'listen' for an invite coming in - when should the profile page update
    - Need to filter upcoming games by date
    

### Bugs 
    - can manually change local storage and look at other profiles
    - calling on the dispatch add user in 2 places - login and in the profile page because store would lose state on refresh
    - may be losing the user in the store from not saving state
    - semantic ui form doesn't reset
    
    CurrentBugs- 
    - getting invites to update without hard refresh
    - need to hard refresh to get logout to show up
